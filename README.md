# PowerShell Script Collection
I love automation and making things easier. Scripts are wonderful for this reason. This repo is simply a collection of scripts that I have created to either assist others or for myself.

Because my original scripts are not documented and sometimes...ugly, I am rewriting them for public use. This repo will slowly grow over time.

## Toolset
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- VS Code [PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell)
- [Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). Note that all these scripts use this version of PowerShell. The version that ships with Windows, Core, may not execute these scripts as expected.
