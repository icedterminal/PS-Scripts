# PowerShell Script Collection
I love automation and making things easier. Scripts are wonderful for this reason. This repo is simply a collection of scripts that I have created to either assist others or for myself.

Because my original scripts are not documented and sometimes...ugly - I am rewriting them for public use. This repo will slowly grow over time.
